# sre-challenge-07-myUSD-stablecoin
This repo contains my implementation of SpeedRunEthereum Challenge 06: MyUSD Stablecoin. It’s a decentralized, ETH-backed stablecoin system maintaining a $1 peg using over-collateralization, share-based debt accounting, dynamic interest rates, and liquidations. Built with Scaffold-ETH 2, Hardhat, and Next.js.
